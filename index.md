I'm a software engineer who's passionate about APIs, authentication, and application security. 
Primarily I've used JavaScript, Kotlin, and C#. I've worked on mobile apps using React Native, internal APIs with Hapi.js, [Kong](https://konghq.com/) plugins with Lua, front-end apps with React/Redux, and implemented a number of Keycloak extensions.

I'm currently looking for a new role, either remote or on-site in the southeastern United States.

I'm a software engineer who's passionate about APIs, DevOps, and application security. 
Primarily I've used JavaScript, Kotlin, and C#. I've worked on mobile apps using React Native, internal APIs with Hapi.js, [Kong](https://konghq.com/) plugins with Lua, front-end apps with React/Redux, and implemented a number of Keycloak extensions.
